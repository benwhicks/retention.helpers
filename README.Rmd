# retention.helpers

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of retention.helpers is to provide a few functions to help working with the CSU Retention Team's data set, within the R environment.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("benwhicks/retention.helpers")
```

You should also have the tidyverse installed and loaded to get the most out of the package:

``` r
# install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
```

The best way to interface with the data is through the `retention.data` package. This package is not shared publicly, so you will need to obtain a copy of the R Package itself and build the package yourself. This is done in RStudio using `Ctrl-Shift-B` or by going to the _Build_ pane (usually in the top right along with _Environment_) and selecting _Install and Restart_. 

## Overview of functions

Most of the functions are split into groups based on their use and prefix. The main families are `add_`, `affix_`,  and `fetch_.`

### `add_*`

The `add_` family of functions create new columns in a data frame based on data *in that table only*. This means they are the most broadly useful as the do not require `retention.data` loaded. For example if `offering` is in the data frame (in the form `ABC123_201990_W_D`) then we can extract the subject `ABC123`, session `201990` or year `2019`. 

<details><summary>See an example of using the `add_*` functions</summary>
``` {r add-example}
# Given some data with offering
dat_with_offering <- tibble(
  offering = c("MTH100_189030_P_D", "PHL105_189060_B_I")
)

dat_with_offering

# Add in subject and year from offering
dat_with_offering %>% 
  add_subject_from_offering() %>% 
  add_year_from_offering()
```
</details>

### `affix_*`

The `affix_` family of functions create new columns in a data frame that are aggregations of the data loaded, based on the groupings in the input data frame. For instance if you feed `affix_demographics` a data frame consisting of *subject* and *session*, it will aggregate by subject and session and append a variety of demogrpahic measures to the data frame.


<details><summary>See an example of using the `affix_*` functions</summary>
``` {r affix-example}
# Given some data with a subject
dat_with_subject <- tibble(
  subject = c("MTH100", "MTH302")
)

dat_with_subject

# Affix aggregated demographic data from the data set and include in this data frame
dat_with_subject %>% 
  affix_demographics()
```
</details>

### `fetch_*`

The `fetch_` family of functions create a new data frame by joining and wrangling the existing data. These a tables that could just be stored as part of the data package but are redundant. For example, `fetch_students` combines the `student_demographics` and `student_progess` tables into a larger table, attempting to get the most recent relavent data for each student (this is because `student_progress` is tied to a given session).

<details><summary>See an example of using the `fetch_*` functions</summary>
``` {r fetch-example}
# Fetching latest student progress data, joined with demographic data 
fetch_students()

```
</details>

## Loading the Data

This package is designed to work _with_ the retention data set. This can be loaded two ways:

You can load from a folder containing the .rda files directly:

``` {r example-loading-data-rda-files, eval = FALSE}
# ============================================= #
# Loading via a folder of the .rda files
# ============================================= #
library(tidyverse)
folder_of_rda_files <- file.path('~', 'path', 'to', 'folder') # Change this to where you have them stored
rda_files <- list.files(folder_of_rda_files, 
                        pattern = ".rda", 
                        full.names = TRUE) # This grabs only rda files in folder_of_rda_files
# Loading the data into your environment
rda_files %>% 
  map(load)
```

Or you can load from the `retention.data` package:

```{r example-loading-data-from-package, eval=FALSE}
# ============================================= #
# Loading data via the retention.data package
# ============================================= #
library(retention.data)
```

The benefit of using the package version of the data is that it comes with in built documentation, using R's usual help syntax, `?`.

``` {r example-help, eval = FALSE}
?student_progress
```


## Data Model

This is the **intended** end product, but not all tables are complete or tidy yet.

``` {r data-model, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
# TODO: Copy the data_model.yml file across from the retention.data package to the root of this package whenever this is updated.
library(datamodelr)
dm <- dm_read_yaml('data_model.yml')
gp <- dm_create_graph(dm, rankdir = "RL")
dm_export_graph(gp, "data-model.png", height = 1200)
```

## Further Examples

### Wrangling


### Adding variables

``` {r example-adding-variables}
# creating a data frame with offerings
library(retention.helpers)
offs <- tibble(offering = c("MTH120_189030_P_D", "PHL100_189030_P_D"))
offs

# adding the subject and year
offs %>% 
  add_subject_from_offering() %>% 
  add_year_from_offering()
```

### Joining 

``` {r example-joining}
# Joining demographics and academic
student_demographics %>% 
  inner_join(academic, by = "id") %>% 
  head()

# Joining progress and academic and flags
flags %>% 
  inner_join(academic, by = c("id", "subject", "session"))
```

### Visualising

``` {r example-visualising}
# Trying to visualise grade distributions of flagged vs non flagged
academic %>% 
  left_join(
    flags %>% 
      filter(campaign == "pre census") %>% # only looking at pre census flags
      select(id, subject, session) %>% # only selecting what is required for joining with academic
      mutate(flagged = "At risk"), # left join as we want all academic, which creates NA's if no match
    by = c("id", "subject", "session")) %>%  
  mutate(flagged = replace_na(flagged, "Not at risk")) %>% # NA's did not appear in the flag table
  ggplot(aes(grade)) +
  stat_count(aes(fill = flagged)) +
  facet_grid(flagged ~ session) +
  theme_minimal() 
```
