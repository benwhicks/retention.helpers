Given a course filtering this returns a data table with one row
per student per session with as much demographic, retention and academic
data as possible. By default it only includes flags with the concerns:
\emph{course requirement, low activity, non submission} and \emph{prior performance}.
You \emph{must} have the \code{retention.data} package loaded for this
to work, or the equivalent tables.
Some of the calculated fields are worth explaining:
\itemize{
\item \strong{progress_rate} is the ratio of passing grades (PS, CR, DI, HD) to all grades
\item \strong{pass_rate} is the ratio of passing grades to all finalised grades
\item \strong{fail_rate} is the ratio of failing grades (FL, FW) to all grades
\item \strong{fw_rate} is the ratio of FW (fail by non submission) to all grades
}
}
