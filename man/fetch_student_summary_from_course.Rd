\title{Gets a beefed up table of student data by session based on course}
\usage{
fetch_student_summary_from_course(
  course_filter_string = ".",
  concerns = c("course requirement", "low activity", "non submission",
    "prior performance")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{course_filter_string}{A regex expression used to filter on the course}

\item{concerns}{A list of options from for the concern field in the flags table.}
}
\value{
a data frame, one row per student per session
}
\description{
Given a course filtering this returns a data table with one row
per student per session with as much demographic, retention and academic
data as possible. By default it only includes flags with the concerns:
\emph{course requirement, low activity, non submission} and \emph{prior performance}.
You \emph{must} have the \code{retention.data} package loaded for this
to work, or the equivalent tables.
Some of the calculated fields are worth explaining:
* \strong{progress_rate} is the ratio of passing grades (PS, CR, DI, HD) to all grades
* \strong{pass_rate} is the ratio of passing grades to all finalised grades
* \strong{fail_rate} is the ratio of failing grades (FL, FW) to all grades
* \strong{fw_rate} is the ratio of FW (fail by non submission) to all grades
}
